You are given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in order A, B & C.
Where A is the coefficient of X2,  B is the coefficient of X and C is the constant term in the most simplified form.
Example: For  X2 + 5X + 6 = 0, you are given the input as: 1 5 6.
Write a program to find all of the roots of the quadratic.
Sample Input :
1 5 6
Sample Output :
-2.00
-3.00



a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
d = ((b**2)-(4*a*c))**0.5
m = (d-b)/(2*a)
n = -(d+b)/(2*a)
print(f'{m:.2f}')
print(f'{n:.2f}')
